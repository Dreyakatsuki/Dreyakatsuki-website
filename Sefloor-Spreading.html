                <h3>Process of Seafloor Spreading</h3>
                <p>The process of seafloor spreading is a fundamental mechanism in plate tectonics that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Rows">
                <h3>Mid-Ocean Ridges</h3>
                <p>A mid-ocean ridge is a long mountain range on the ocean floor, characterized by volcanic activity and the creation of new oceanic 
                crust through seafloor spreading. These underwater mountain chains stretch across the Earth's oceans, forming the longest mountain range on the planet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Rows">
                <h3>Plate Tectonics</h3>
                <p>Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that describes the Earth's outer shell, or lithosphere, 
                as being divided into several large and small plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. 
                These plates are in constant motion, driven by the processes occurring within the Earth's mantle.</p>
