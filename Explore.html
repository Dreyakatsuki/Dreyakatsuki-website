            <p>Seafloor spreading is a geologic process in which tectonic plates—large slabs of Earth's lithosphere—split apart from each other.</p><br>
            <p>The usual process at work at divergent plate boundaries, leading to the creation of new ocean floor</p>

            <div class="defi">
                <p>Seafloor spreading and other tectonic activity processes are the result of mantle convection. Mantle convection is the slow, churning motion of Earth’s mantle.
                Convection currents carry heat from the lower mantle and core to the lithosphere. Convection currents also “recycle” lithospheric materials back to the mantle.</p><br>
                <p>Seafloor spreading occurs at divergent plate boundaries. As tectonic plates slowly move away from each other, heat from the mantle’s convection currents makes the crust more plastic and less dense. The less-dense material rises, often forming a mountain or elevated area of the seafloor. Eventually, the crust cracks. Hot magma fueled by mantle convection bubbles up to fill these fractures and spills onto the crust. This bubbled-up magma is cooled by frigid seawater to form igneous rock.
                This rock (basalt) becomes a new part of Earth’s crust.</p>

                <p>Seafloor spreading is a geological process by which new oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges through volcanic activities and then slowly moves away from the ridges. Seafloor spreading occurs at divergent boundaries where the tectonic plates move away from each other, resulting in the formation of new seafloor. These divergent boundaries are usually found between oceanic plates as mid-ocean ridges. For example, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Eurasian Plate from the North American Plate and the African Plate from the South American Plate. Another mid-ocean ridge, the East Pacific Rise,
                separates the North American, Cocos, Nazca, and Antarctic plates from the Pacific Plate. <br> <br>
                However, all mid-ocean ridges do not show consistent seafloor spreading; some are slow-spreading, whereas others are rapidly spreading ridges. It is to be noted that while seafloor spreading creates a new oceanic crust, the old lithospheric material is ‘recycled’ back into the Earth’s mantle at the subduction zones.
                These two forces balance each other, keeping the shape and diameter of the Earth constant.</p>

                <p>The Mid-Ocean Ridges is aContinuous range of underwater volcanoes that wraps around the globe like seams on a baseball, stretching nearly 65,000 kilometers (40,390 miles).</p>
                <p>With new sea floor being pushed and pulled out, the older sea floor slowly slides away from the mid-oceanic ridges toward the continents.</p><br><br>
                <p>A mid-ocean ridge (MOR) is a seafloor mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It typically has a depth of about 2,600 meters (8,500 ft) and rises about 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) 
                above the deepest portion of an ocean basin. This feature is where seafloor spreading takes place along a divergent plate boundary.</p>

                <p>Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that explains how major landforms are created as a result of Earth’s subterranean movements. The theory, which solidified in the 1960s,
                transformed the earth sciences by explaining many phenomena, including mountain building events, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</p><br><br>
                <p>In plate tectonics, Earth’s outermost layer, or lithosphere—made up of the crust and upper mantle—is broken into large rocky plates. These plates lie on top of a partially molten layer of rock called the asthenosphere. 
                Due to the convection of the asthenosphere and lithosphere, the plates move relative to each other at different rates, from two to 15 centimeters (one to six inches) per year.</p>

                    <img src="download (3).jpg">
                    <p>A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Along these boundaries, earthquakes are common and magma (molten rock)
                    rises from the Earth’s mantle to the surface, solidifying to create new oceanic crust. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an example of divergent plate boundaries.</p>

                    <h3>Convergent plate boundary</h3>
                    <img src="download.jpg">
                    <p>When two plates come together, it is known as a convergent boundary. The impact of the colliding plates can cause the edges of one or both
                    plates to buckle up into a mountain ranges or one of the plates may bend down into a deep seafloor trench. A chain of volcanoes often forms 
                    parallel to convergent plate boundaries and powerful earthquakes are common along these boundaries. The Pacific Ring of Fire is an example of a convergent plate boundary.</p>

                    <h3>Transform plate boundary</h3>
                    <img src="download (1).jpg">
                    <p>Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary. One of the most famous transform plate boundaries occurs at the San Andreas fault zone, 
                    which extends underwater. Natural or human-made structures that cross a transform boundary are offset — split into pieces and carried in opposite directions. 
                    Rocks that line the boundary are pulverized as the plates grind along, creating a linear fault valley or undersea canyon. Earthquakes are common along these faults.
                    In contrast to convergent and divergent boundaries, crust is cracked and broken at transform margins, but is not created or destroyed.</p>
